HarvardX: PH125.5x: Data Science - Capstone

This repo was created to file and share the two projects within the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate (see https://courses.edx.org/dashboard/programs/3c32e3e0-b6fe-4ee4-bd4f-210c6339e074/)

The first project (capstone-movielens) was to develop and refine an algorithm for a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 10M dataset such that it was able to predict ratings with a residual mean square error of less than 0.86490.
